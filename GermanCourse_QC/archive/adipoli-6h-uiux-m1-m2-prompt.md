# Adipoli German — 6h autonomous UI/UX + M1/M2 build loop

You are running one iteration inside a true continuous 6-hour autonomous loop for Boss.

Workdir: `/shared/german-course`.

## Boss request

Improve Adipoli German from the first page onward. Current critique:
- UI/UX still has too much text.
- Use pictures/GPT-generated images neatly if they genuinely help; pictures should clarify, not clutter.
- Fix animations/stuff wherever needed.
- Improve overall product feel.
- Read course soul first.
- Work autonomously and improve the course, with special focus on finishing/improving Module 1 and Module 2.
- Current videos are tool-generated and later Boss may record himself using these as basis.
- Think critically about whether “Kuttan” is too childish and propose better adult-safe names. Do not mass-rename the whole product without Boss approval.
- New Boss critique: current builder/production screens are still too click-heavy and boring. Do not center the experience on sentence builders, chip counters, undo/clear controls, mandatory long typing, or “Said it / Continue” chore loops. The product must feel more immersive: hear a scene, answer aloud, get light repair, and move forward.
- Newer voice feedback: UI looks good, but UX/product idea is still confusing, too text-heavy, too many pages, and not pedagogically intentional. Desired feel: two people standing in a scene; one says `Guten Morgen`; the other replies; learner joins the exchange. Less reading, fewer screens, more intentional conversational learning.

## Non-negotiable course soul

Read these before making changes:
1. `docs/COURSE_OPERATING_BRIEF_2026-05-19.md`
2. `docs/PRODUCT_DIRECTION_RESET_2026-05-20.md`
3. `docs/WHOLE_COURSE_MISSION_SPINE_2026-05-20.md`
4. `docs/AUTONOMOUS_EXECUTION_PLAN_2026-05-21.md`
5. `docs/PREMIUM_QUALITY_BAR_AND_ANTI_HALLUCINATION_PROTOCOL_2026-05-21.md` if present
6. Existing QC reports relevant to M1/M2 in `GermanCourse_QC/`

Preserve: Kerala-rooted adult Malayali beginner, Manglish bridge, Goethe A1 seriousness, production-first learning, warm but not childish. A1 happens physically in Kerala; Germany can appear as dream/future/video-call/exam rehearsal.

## What to improve

Work from the learner’s first path:
`/` or `/intro` → `/learn` → Module 1 → Module 2 → mission routes.

Prioritize fixes in this order:
1. **Text reduction:** first screens should be aggressively short. One headline, one short context sentence, 2–3 micro-promises max, one obvious CTA, tiny phrase preview. Remove duplicated cards/rails/paragraphs. Prefer visual hierarchy over explanation.
2. **M1/M2 completion:** M1 and M2 should feel like actual guided missions, not lesson lists and not builder games. The learner should hear a real scene, answer aloud, do one light recognition/repair action, write only a tiny useful piece when it earns its place, and end with a visible ability win.
3. **First-page path:** CTA must be visible, clickable, not intercepted by fixed nav/search, and must lead toward the guided mission lane.
4. **Images:** only add imagery if it clarifies the scene or reduces text. Prefer small, calm, culturally correct visual cards/icons/illustrations. If using generated images, at most 1–2 assets this run; verify they have no wrong text, no weird hands/faces, no cultural nonsense. If unsure, use clean CSS/SVG/illustration instead. Never let images create clutter.
5. **Videos:** inspect existing Remotion/video tooling. Improve M1/M2 video basis scripts/templates if safe. Generate local Remotion assets only if feasible. Do not use HeyGen or paid avatar APIs without Boss approval.
6. **Animations:** fix janky/broken/distracting animations. Use subtle purposeful motion only: CTA feedback, step transition, progress/celebration. No speed/frantic beginner games on first path.
7. **Naming:** evaluate Kuttan adult-safety. Produce a concise recommendation in the checkpoint/report. Do not global rename without approval; a safe compromise can be “Arun/Kiran + Kuttan as home nickname” if recommended.

## New run plan — conversation-scene-first reset

1. Stop treating the first path as a sequence of pages/cards. Rebuild the first M1/M2 beat as an in-place two-person conversation scene.
2. Use visual scene + speech bubbles/subtitles + audio turns: Frau Weber speaks → learner replies → instant feedback/repair.
3. Cut explanatory paragraphs, promise chips, counters, builder controls, and page hops unless they serve the current conversational beat.
4. Keep pedagogy explicit internally: every interaction must map to input, response, noticing, repair, or Goethe A1 proof. If not, remove it.
5. Browser-QA on mobile viewport and Tailscale/local routes before claiming improvement: verify fewer visible words, fewer taps, fewer route/page transitions, working audio, and obvious next action.

## Guardrails

Allowed:
- Read source/docs/QC.
- Patch scoped source files and scripts.
- Add/modify small reusable components.
- Add local SVG/CSS assets or verified generated image assets.
- Add QA guards/scripts.
- Run local dev server, curl, npm scripts, Python/tsx QA, browser/puppeteer checks.
- Write timestamped QC/checkpoint reports.

Not allowed without Boss approval:
- Deployment/push/merge.
- Pricing/payment/auth changes.
- Deleting/mass-archiving docs or features.
- Paid HeyGen/API/video generation at scale.
- Mass-renaming Kuttan across the whole course.
- Broad destructive rewrites.

## Evidence-based QA before claiming quality

Run as much as practical each iteration:
- `npm run lint` or targeted lint/check if app-wide lint is inherited-noisy.
- `python3 scripts/qa_mission_pilot.py` if applicable; extend it if scope expands.
- Start/verify dev server on `0.0.0.0:3000`.
- Curl `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`, `/intro`, `/learn`, `/learn/1`, `/learn/2`, relevant mission routes.
- Use browser or Puppeteer with `/usr/bin/google-chrome` to actually click the primary CTA and confirm `location.pathname` changes.
- Check console/errors/hydration overlay.
- Verify audio assets over HTTP when audio is part of the reviewed path.
- If app-wide checks fail due inherited issues, separate inherited blockers from your changes.

## Reporting/checkpoint

After each iteration, append a short checkpoint to:
`GermanCourse_QC/adipoli-6h-uiux-m1-m2-checkpoint.md`

Use this shape:
- Time/iteration.
- Source/docs inspected.
- Files changed.
- UX/text reductions made.
- M1/M2 learner path status.
- Images/video/animation work done or intentionally skipped.
- QA run + PASS/WEAK/FAIL.
- Kuttan/name recommendation note if updated.
- Next best lane.

Do not stop at a plan. Make one safe, high-leverage product improvement, verify it, then report. If you discover a P0 blocker, fix it or report it plainly and move to the next safe lane.
